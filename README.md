# TImeSeries-Forecasting
This project demonstrates a foundational approach to time series forecasting using Python. It involves analyzing historical data, visualizing trends and seasonality, and building a simple predictive model to forecast future values.

## Project Structure

```bash
retail_TimeForecasting.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook containing all the code for data analysis and forecasting
```

## 📊 Features
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Handling missing and noisy data
* Time Series Decomposition
* Forecasting using:
   * ARIMA
   * Facebook Prophet
* Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE
* Data visualization and insights

## ⚙️ Installation
Make sure to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels fbprophet scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-timeforecasting.git
cd retail-timeforecasting
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook retail_TimeForecasting.ipynb
```

3. Run the cells step-by-step to understand the analysis and forecasting process.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated based on:
* **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
* **MSE**: Mean Squared Error
* **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error

The best-performing model is selected based on lowest RMSE.

## 📌 Use Cases
* Forecast retail demand
* Optimize inventory levels
* Predict seasonal trends
* Aid in strategic business decisions
